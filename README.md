# Thruplr App

## To Run
1. Install dependencies - `npm install`

2. Start the app -- `npx expo start`

3. Commonly used keyboard Shortcuts (all lowercase, just type hit the button while the terminal is in focus):
   - `a`: open Android emulator
   - `i`: open iOS emulator
   - `w`: open web (we're not using this at the moment, but maybe in the future)
   - `r`: reload app
   - `j`: opens a debugger window (looks just like chrome debugger)
